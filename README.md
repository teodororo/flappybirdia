Flappy Birds using AI

Concepts of Q-learning is used, where I have tried to discretize the state space. 3-D Q-matrix is used to implement the problem. One dimension signifies the horizontal distance of the bird from the lower pipe, the second dimension signifies the vertical distance of the bird from lower pipe and the last dimension signifies whether the bird has to jump/flap or not.
